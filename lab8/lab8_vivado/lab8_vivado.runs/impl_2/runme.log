WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PDRC-153) Gated clock check - Net l1_status_reg[0]/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin l1_status_reg[0]/L3_2/O, cell l1_status_reg[0]/L3_2 (in l1_status_reg[0] macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
