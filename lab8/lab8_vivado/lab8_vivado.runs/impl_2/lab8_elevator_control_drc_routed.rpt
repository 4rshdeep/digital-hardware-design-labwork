2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net l1_control/l1_status_reg[0]/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin l1_control/l1_status_reg[0]/L3_2/O, cell l1_control/l1_status_reg[0]/L3_2 (in l1_control/l1_status_reg[0] macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net l1_control/l1_status_reg[1]/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin l1_control/l1_status_reg[1]/L3_2/O, cell l1_control/l1_status_reg[1]/L3_2 (in l1_control/l1_status_reg[1] macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net l1_control/lift_status is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin l1_control/lift_status_reg[1]_i_2/O, cell l1_control/lift_status_reg[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net l2_control/l2_status_reg[0]/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin l2_control/l2_status_reg[0]/L3_2/O, cell l2_control/l2_status_reg[0]/L3_2 (in l2_control/l2_status_reg[0] macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net l2_control/l2_status_reg[1]/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin l2_control/l2_status_reg[1]/L3_2/O, cell l2_control/l2_status_reg[1]/L3_2 (in l2_control/l2_status_reg[1] macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net l2_control/lift_status is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin l2_control/lift_status_reg[1]_i_2__0/O, cell l2_control/lift_status_reg[1]_i_2__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
